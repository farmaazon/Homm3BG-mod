\addsection{New units' and dwellings' costs}{\images/estates.png}

\textit{This modification tries to address the problem with restoring an Army after losses. The Recruitment cost of Units is partially transferred to their Dwellings, Reinforce cost is shared with some Dwellings and sometimes Citadel, \svg{building_materials} and \svg{valuables} costs are also rearranged slightly. This rather does not play well with "Dice Stacks" modification.}

\begin{multicols*}{2}
    Besides new costs of Dwellings, Citadel and Units, this modification introduces upgrades of \svg{golden} Dwellings, which is now necessary to recruit and reinforce most expensive \svg{golden} Unit. When built, place a Faction Cube on \svg{golden} Dwelling tile on your Town Board.
